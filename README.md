#### Introducing botchat web application

The app is available at [Heroku](https://wadbot.herokuapp.com/)!

3 working modes:

- Short polling
- Long polling
- Websockets

There is a predifined set of word combinations used by bot to reply to your messages. Each 30 seconds bot generates a message himself.
Message history is cleared each 30 minutes or manually.

Possible messages to the bot:

1. "Hello/hi/hey"
2. Ask about weather
3. "How are you"
4. Ask about favorite food
5. "I'm bored"
6. "How old are you?"
7. "Heads or tails!"
8. "Good bye"
9. "ok/lol/thanks"
10. "You are silly" :smile:
